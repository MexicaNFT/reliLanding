You can opt-in to share data during the tool-making process.By default, we will not use data submitted by customers via our API to train OpenAI models or improve our service offerings. Data submitted by the user for fine-tuning will only be used to fine-tune the customer's model. However, we will allow users to opt-in to share their data to improve model performance. Sharing your data will ensure that future iterations of the model improve for your use cases. Data submitted to the API prior to April 1, 2023, may have been used for improvements if the customer had not previously opted out of sharing data."

            content="Any data sent through the API will be retained for abuse and misuse monitoring purposes for a maximum of 30 days, after which it will be deleted (unless otherwise required by law). This applies to both user prompts and completions, as well as training data submitted to fine-tune models via the Files endpoint. We refer to this data as API data. A limited number of authorized Reli.Ai and OpenAI employees, as well as specialized third-party contractors subject to confidentiality and security obligations, can access this data solely to investigate and verify suspected abuse. Enterprise customers deploying use cases with a low likelihood of misuse may request not to have API data stored at all, including for safety monitoring and prevention. OpenAI may still have content classifiers flag when data is suspected to contain platform abuse. Data submitted by the user through the Files endpoint, for instance, to fine-tune a model, is retained until the user deletes the file.For more information on the technical protections, security certifications, data storage, encryption, and other relevant details, please refer to our Frequently Asked Questions section above.If you have any questions or concerns about our data policy, please contact us at support@reli.ai."
